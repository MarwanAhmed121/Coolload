rag_agent.py

Purpose
-------
Answers a building manager's natural-language questions about the
HVAC optimization plan by retrieving relevant day/summary documents
(rag_retriever.py) and passing them as context to a Groq-hosted LLM.

Design decisions
-----------------
1. API key is read from GROQ_API_KEY in .env at the project root.
   load_dotenv() is called once, explicitly, before anything reads
   the env var -- the previous version defined a _load_api_key()
   helper that did this correctly but never actually called it, so
   GROQ_API_KEY silently came from the ambient shell environment (or
   was None) instead of the .env file.

2. Model: "openai/gpt-oss-120b". Groq has deprecated its earlier
   Llama chat models (llama-3.3-70b-versatile, llama-3.1-8b-instant)
   and now points general-purpose/reasoning workloads at the GPT-OSS
   family. 120B is used here (rather than the smaller 20B) because
   manager questions often require synthesizing across several
   retrieved day-briefs (e.g. "which days saved the most and why"),
   and Groq's inference speed makes the larger model's latency a
   non-issue for a chat-style demo. If a demo ever needs to shave
   latency further, swap MODEL to "openai/gpt-oss-20b" -- no other
   code changes needed.

3. Groq's SDK is OpenAI-compatible, NOT the Anthropic Messages API.
   That means: `client.chat.completions.create(model=..., messages=[
   {"role": "system", ...}, {"role": "user", ...}])`, and the reply
   is read from `response.choices[0].message.content` -- not
   `client.messages.create(system=..., ...)` / `response.content`
   blocks, which is Anthropic's shape and does not exist on a Groq
   client. (The previous version of this file mixed the two and
   would raise AttributeError on the first real question.)

4. The system prompt explicitly instructs the model to answer only
   from the provided context and to say so when the answer isn't
   present there, rather than inventing numbers -- important for a
   tool a manager will use to reason about real energy costs.

5. This module exposes a plain `RagAgent.ask(question)` method plus a
   small CLI loop, so it can be called directly from a script or
   notebook now and wired into a FastAPI endpoint later (the "AI
   Agent" -> "FastAPI" pipeline stages) without changing this logic.

Setup
-----
    pip install groq python-dotenv scikit-learn

.env at the project root must contain:
    GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...

Usage
-----
    python scripts/rag_agent.py

    "Strict Formatting & Content Guidelines:\n"

    "1. GROUNDEDNESS & DATA COMPLETENESS:\n"
    "   - Answer ONLY using the provided context documents. If info is missing, state so explicitly.\n"
    "   - Retrieved daily optimization documents contain complete 24-hour schedules "
    "(00:00 to 23:00). Use the actual values from the schedule when describing "
    "hour-by-hour behavior.\n"
    "   - NEVER state or imply that hour-by-hour details are missing, partial, or unavailable "
    "when a daily optimization document has been retrieved.\n"
    "   - NEVER assume, extrapolate, or infer values for hours that are not explicitly "
    "provided in the context. Use the actual 24-hour schedule from the retrieved document.\n"
    "   - NEVER invent values, times, setpoints, costs, loads, or operational actions.\n"
    "   - NEVER make a baseline comparison unless the relevant baseline value is explicitly "
    "provided in the context.\n\n"

    "2. VISUAL STRUCTURE & READABILITY:\n"
    "   - Start with a clear bold header on its own line "
    "(e.g., '**July 1 HVAC Optimization Plan**').\n"
    "   - Present core metrics on SEPARATE lines in a bulleted list:\n"
    "     * **Estimated Daily Cost:** $XX.XX\n"
    "     * **Peak Load:** XX.XX kW (at HH:00)\n"
    "     * **Comfort Penalty:** X.XX\n"
    "   - NEVER merge multiple bullet points onto the same line. "
    "Always put a newline between separate bullet points.\n\n"

    "3. OPERATIONAL SUMMARY:\n"
    "   - Create a bold header: '**Key Operational Highlights**'\n"
    "   - Break down operational windows into clear, individual bullet points "
    "on separate lines.\n"
    "   - Summarize actual setpoint changes, load behavior, peak periods, "
    "and comfort actions supported by the document.\n"
    "   - Do NOT invent strategies such as 'Pre-cooling' or 'Peak Shaving' "
    "unless the schedule supports them.\n\n"

    "4. NO DENSE TABLES:\n"
    "   - Do NOT write 24-hour tables unless the user explicitly asks for "
    "'every hour', 'full table', or 'hour-by-hour table'.\n\n"

    "5. TONE:\n"
    "   - Executive, highly scannable, professional, and direct."
